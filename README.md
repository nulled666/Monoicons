## Monoicons ##

A Set of SVG Font Icons for Web.

I made this set of pixel perfect icons (on 14px) and the export script, because the icons in Awesome icons font is not very consistent in style, and hard to edit.

Simple include the monoicons.css & eot/ttf/woff/svg font files in your project and refer to the css in your HTML files.
Use &lt;i class="mi-*up*">&lt;/i> to insert icons.
For old browsers don't support the :before pseudo class, you can use &lt;i class="mi-box">&#x*e003*;&lt;/i> instead. The &#x*e003*; code can found found when hover on an icon item of the monoicons.htm file.

###How to make your own font###
* Edit the Source File monoicons-14x14.fw.png  (Adobe Fireworks CS6 Format).
You can easily subset the icons or add your own icons by editing the PNG file.

* Use the ExportSVGFont.jsf extension script in Fireworks CS6 to export icons into a SVG font file.
The script will read the slices list and slice name to export the monoicons.svg font file and the preview HTM file.

* Then you can convert it into other font format using any font conversion services online.
